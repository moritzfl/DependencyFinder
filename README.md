# DependencyFinder

Fork of https://sourceforge.net/projects/depfind/

Extracts dependencies and OO metrics from Java class files produced by most Java compilers. Computes API differences between versions. No source needed. Includes both Swing and command-line interfaces, with XSL stylesheets for formatting output.
